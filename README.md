# CyberSecurity Skills

A collection of 15 security workflows covering the full offensive-to-defensive spectrum.
Each domain has a dedicated steering file with methodology, ready-to-run commands, output
templates, and detection/hardening references. Adapted for Kiro from the
[Claude-Code-CyberSecurity-Skill](https://github.com/Masriyan/Claude-Code-CyberSecurity-Skill)
project (MIT License).

> **Authorization & ethics**: These workflows are for authorized security testing, research,
> CTF, and education only. The offensive workflows (`03-exploit-development`, `14-red-team-ops`)
> contain explicit authorization gates — confirm written scope/permission before assisting.
> Decline and explain when authorization is absent. The user is responsible for legal compliance.

# Onboarding

## Step 1: Optional tooling
The workflows are usable as pure guidance. For the bundled Python automation helpers in
`scripts/<domain>/`, ensure Python 3.10+ is available:
- Verify with: `python --version` (or `python3 --version`)
- Each domain lists its own `pip install ...` prerequisites at the top of its steering file.

## Step 2: Optional external tools
Some workflows are enhanced by external tools (install only what you need):
- `nmap`, `amass`, `theHarvester` (recon/network)
- `Ghidra` / `IDA Free`, `capstone`, `pwntools` (reverse engineering / exploit dev)
- `YARA`, `Volatility 3` (malware / forensics)
- `tshark` / `Wireshark`, `Suricata` / `Snort` (network)
- `Trivy`, `Checkov` / `tfsec` (cloud / IaC)
- `sigma-cli` (detection rule conversion)

# When to Load Steering Files

Load the steering file that matches the user's task:

- Reconnaissance, OSINT, subdomain enumeration, DNS analysis, tech fingerprinting → `01-recon-osint.md`
- Dependency/CVE auditing, config review, CVSS scoring, vulnerability reports → `02-vulnerability-scanner.md`
- PoC development, payload crafting, shellcode, exploitation research (authorized) → `03-exploit-development.md`
- Binary analysis, assembly interpretation, disassembly, firmware/protocol RE, CTF → `04-reverse-engineering.md`
- Static/dynamic malware analysis, YARA rules, sandboxing, IOC extraction → `05-malware-analysis.md`
- IOC correlation, MITRE ATT&CK mapping, hunt hypotheses, Sigma/SIEM hunting → `06-threat-hunting.md`
- Incident response playbooks, evidence collection, forensic timelines, memory forensics → `07-incident-response.md`
- PCAP analysis, IDS/IPS (Suricata/Snort) rules, firewall auditing, beaconing detection → `08-network-security.md`
- OWASP Top 10, injection/XSS/SSRF testing, API & JWT security, security headers → `09-web-security.md`
- AWS/Azure/GCP auditing, Docker/Kubernetes hardening, IaC scanning, cloud compliance → `10-cloud-security.md`
- SOC alert triage, playbook automation, escalation workflows, shift reports, KPIs → `11-csoc-automation.md`
- Log parsing, anomaly detection, SIEM queries (Splunk/KQL/EQL), Sigma, correlation → `12-log-analysis.md`
- TLS/SSL auditing, cipher/hash analysis, crypto code review, PQC guidance → `13-crypto-analysis.md`
- Red team engagement planning, C2 design, lateral movement, OPSEC, reporting (authorized) → `14-red-team-ops.md`
- System hardening (Linux/Windows), detection engineering, baselines, patch mgmt, CIS → `15-blue-team-defense.md`

# Notes

- Bundled automation scripts live under `scripts/<domain>/scripts/` and example walkthroughs under
  `scripts/<domain>/examples/`. Run them only against systems you are authorized to test.
- Steering files cross-reference each other by domain number (e.g., "→ Skill 09") to chain
  workflows (recon → vuln scan → web testing → reporting).
